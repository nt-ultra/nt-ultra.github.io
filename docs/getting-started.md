Inspired by Firefox's Home Page, New Tab Ultra gives you quick access to more of your favorite websites, more nav focused design, more customization, more choices, less clutter. NT Ultra is also pretty private! No tracking. Can run locally! Data stored locally. No other dependencies, besides Internet to take you to your next destination.

You can find helpful documentation for almost everything related to New Tab Ultra here. IF you still can't find what you're looking for, [post an issue](https://github.com/nt-ultra/nt-ultra/issues?q=is%3Aissue) on the Github.
