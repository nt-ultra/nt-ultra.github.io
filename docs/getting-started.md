# Getting Started

Inspired by Firefox's Home Page, New Tab Ultra gives you quick access to more of your favorite websites, more nav focused design, more customization, more choices, less clutter. NT Ultra is also pretty private! No tracking. Can run locally! Data stored locally. Synced data excludes Wallpapers. No other dependencies, besides Internet to take you to your next destination.

You can find helpful documentation for almost everything related to New Tab Ultra here. IF you still can't find what you're looking for, [post an issue](https://github.com/nt-ultra/nt-ultra/issues?q=is%3Aissue) on the Github.

## Install NT Ultra

You can get the extension on the main platforms:

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-ultra-nt-ultra/"><img width="33%" height="auto" src="/img/addff.png" /></a>

<a href=""><img width="33%" height="auto" src="/img/addedge.png" /></a>


## Run Locally (optional)

In Firefox, with the exception of the Tab Browser, NT Ultra is fully functional when run locally (mostly due to prioritizing IndexDB). Firefox handles this in it's Settings, but a new tab override might be a viable approach as well.

1. `git clone https://github.com/nt-ultra/nt-ultra.git`
2. Firefox Settings > Home > Custom URL > `file:///path/to/nt-ultra/index.html`
