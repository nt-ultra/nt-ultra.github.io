# Shortcuts

Managing shortcuts is made to be extremely simple. Like Firefox with extra qol.

## New shortcuts

You can create new shortcuts in a couple of ways

- Manually via the `+ New` shortcut button
- By dragging links into the shortcut grid
- By dragging tabs from the `Tab Browser` into the shortcut grid
- By importing saved shortcuts via `Settings` -> `Database` -> `Import`
- By right clicking links on any website `Right click` -> `Turn into Shortcut`
- By multi-selecting tabs `Right click` -> `Turn into Shortcut`

## Shortcut limits

In `Sidebar Settings` -> `Shortcuts`, there is a slider for max shortcuts, currently that limit is set to 168. This max limit refers to the amount of items in the shortcut grid (a made up value). So technically, it applies to the amount of folders OR shortcuts in the grid. For example, 168 folders can exist in the grid, but those folders do not have a defined "shortcut limit".

## Folders

Folders let you organize shortcuts in whatever way you see fit, folders are a new feature (thus experimental).
