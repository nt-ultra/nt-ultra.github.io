# Tab Browser

The Tab Browser is a convenient way to interact with your tabs. From multiple windows, to tab groups. You can:

- View a full list of tabs organized by window or tab group
- Move tabs between windows or groups (drag & drop)
- Turn tabs into shortcuts (drag & drop)
- Close, Mute, Unmute tabs, pin, unload, reload
- Navigate to them

You can drag a tab into the shortcuts grid to automatically fetch it's url, title, and favicon for newly created shortcuts.
