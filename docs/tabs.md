# Tab Browser

The Tab Browser is a convenient way to view all tabs open on multiple Windows. It's mostly just for display, but can be used to quickly turn open tabs into Shortcuts. You can drag a tab into the shortcuts grid to automatically fetch it's url, title, and favicon for the newly created shortcut.
