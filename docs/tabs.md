# Tab Browser

The Tab Browser is a convenient way to interact with all your tabs from multiple Windows. It can be used to:

- View a full list of tabs between windows
- Navigate to tabs between windows
- Close, Mute, Unmute tabs
- And turn tabs into shortcuts (drag & drop)

You can drag a tab into the shortcuts grid to automatically fetch it's url, title, and favicon for newly created shortcuts.
