# Theme Management

:::note
"Themes" do not consist of saved shortcuts or wallpapers

NT Ultra's default state is also it's default theme. When you start to change settings, your configuration can be saved as a new theme. This makes it easy to switch between multiple different configurations on the fly.

## Saving Themes

When saving a theme you'll be prompted to enter a name for the theme, and it will be saved into the list of themes to choose from.

## Exporting Themes

When exporting a theme you'll be prompted to enter a description and credit yourself, but this is mostly optional, for if you want to share the theme with others.
